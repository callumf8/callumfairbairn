<h2>New Decade - 28/03/20</h2>
     
<p>It's been a long time since my last update - there is a real shortage of this valuable resource called...free time...in Cambridge! It's been a turbulent year so far and we are only into March. Brexit has officially happened and for most people in the academic community it represents a big new challenege to collaborative and funding opportunities. Nonetheless, I have had a good time progressing with my work in Cambridge and my little grey cells are getting pushed every step of the way. Outside of work it started off as a fab Lent term. We celebrated a fantastic Burn's night in College as I delivered the address to a haggis and joined in with the ceilidhing - a little bit of home!

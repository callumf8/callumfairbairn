            August 2018: Yosemite California 
          </h2>

          <h6> 
            I returned to America to explore another national park. Yosemite boasts beautiful scenery, with deep valleys and smooth domed peaks, carved from the Sierra Nevada landscape. The hiking trails were amazing and I covered 100 miles of them during my three week stay. My literal and personal peak of the trip was the conquering of Half Dome which challenged both the mind and the body on the 4000ft ascent!
